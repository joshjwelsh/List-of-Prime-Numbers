# List-of-Prime-Numbers
creates a list of all prime numbers between 1 and a user defined number (limit)

This project uses the Seive of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine the prime numbers between 2 and a given limit by the user. The user enters the limit and the program outputs the prime numbers in a list.
