# List-of-Prime-Numbers
## Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes approach

This is an OOP approach at solving the question: what are the prime numbers between 2 and a user defined limit (n)

This program prompts the user for a integer < limit > and then outputs the prime numbers between 2 and the limit. 

### How to use it?

Simply clone the git repository into a folder and run the following commands:
1. `javac Seive.java`
2. `java Seive`

Enjoy!
